feel like my fingertips
were made to touch your skin
thereâ€™s only lust for a minute
i never questioned why, i always knew you were mine
loving you is in my dna
loving you is the only way
loving you is in my dna
loving you is in my dna

feel like i hear your voice
so clear above the noise
gave me the faith that i needed
i saw it in your eyes i always knew you were mine

loving you is in my dna
loving you is the only way
loving you is in my dna
loving you is in my dna

is in my dna, is in my dna
is in my dna, is in my dna

loving you is in my dna
loving you is the only way
loving you is in my dna
loving you is in my dna

you know i, i want you
aint no one, above you
you know i, i want you
aint no one, above you
